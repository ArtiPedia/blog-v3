## Features

### Smartphone App like Layout
The theme is designed keeping smartphones users in mind. An app like design is more comfortable to use on a mobile browser.  

### Minimal & Responsive Card Layout
The theme uses a minimal layout for simplicity. Only the things that matter are shown on the homepage. 

**Images:**

Small images will be shown at their actual size.
![small image]({{page.link}}images/ashwathama-1.jpg)


Large images will always scale down and fit in the content container.

**Videos:**

Whenever you add a video, make sure you use the class ``video`` in the iframe or video container. You can also use the shortcode {% raw %}{: .video}{% endraw %} to make the video responsive.

Consider this video for example. If you resize the window to a smaller viewport, the video resizes itself!

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YE7VzlLtp-4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{: .video}

The code is here
{% highlight html %}
<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YE7VzlLtp-4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{% raw %}{: .video}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Take a look at [example post]({{page.link}}example/){: target="blank"} to check responsive nature of other elements.

### 20 Color Schemes!
Customize the theme as you like by using color schemes!

#### Purple

### Clean and Separate CSS
CSS files are separated for easy editing. The theme has separate stylesheets for main elements like header, cards etc.,

### Built-in Contact Form
