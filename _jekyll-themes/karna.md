# Installation: 
Fork the ``master`` branch and delete ``gh-pages`` branch in it. This is important because ``gh-pages`` branch is used here only to host the blog. You should be using the master branch as the source and create a fresh ``gh-pages`` branch.

## How to delete old **gh-pages** branch?
After forking the repository, click on **branches**.

Delete ``gh-pages`` branch.

You have to create a new ``gh-pages`` branch using the master branch. Go back to the forked repository and create ``gh-pages`` branch.

Now, go to settings and check the **Github Pages** section. You should see a URL where the blog is hosted.

This process will host the theme as a **Project Page**. You can also download the files for local development. 

The default theme will look like this

![webjeda karna jekyll theme](http://webjeda.com/karna/images/karna-jekyll-theme-screenshot.png){: .noborder  style="box-shadow: 0 0 5px #777"}


A sample post would look like this

![webjeda karna jekyll theme sidebar](http://webjeda.com/karna/images/post.png){: .noborder style="box-shadow: 0 0 5px #777"}


This theme is made especially for smartphones.
