Few decades ago, making a living was not that big of a thing.

Many websites these days may deceive you into beleive that making money online is really easy. But the fact is that they either got lucky or they are not telling the whole truth.

I used to work as a software engineer for a multinational company. It was all good until I realized that it is a monotonous life without any interesting thing to learn that might help me in the future.

Most of the companies use certain softwares for either development or service. You have to learn in and out of the software. You work on it for years and then let's say you change job. The other company will be using some other software. You have to get used to the new software. 


After learning to use so many softwares, can you do something with it on your own? Nope. A software company will not offer a complete software development to one person. You will be coding just a part of the project which will be assembled later to create a whole package.

So these softwares have no use outside of office. Why should I learn something that has no application in the real world? While working for the company I had developed an interest for building websites. I would like to thank Github, Jekyll and stackoverflow for keeping me hooked.

I wasn't a great performer in the company. I was removed from a project while the management was cutting the cost. They put me in a buffer until I find a new project. I was there for 6 months doing nothing and getting paid for the same!

I used to read a lot of articles/blogs online. I used to find it amazing how a man/woman sitting thousands of miles away can influence me through their words.

I started designing my own websites. Did not learn HTML or CSS properly but started building simple websites. Copied a lot of pre-existing code, used a lot of free templates, came across bootstrap.

I should thank youtube for helping me learn HTML, CSS, JS and other web tools that were necessary to build functional and aesthetic websites.

## Multiple Sources of Income

Having multiple sources of income will give you a confidence and you will not care if you lose one of them.

This is exactly what happened to me. In those 6 months of buffer time. I was supposed to find another project. But I was least interested in it. 

Education did not help me here. My hobby came to the rescue. I used to play a lot of chess. I was the captain of our college chess team.

I decided started a chess class in Bengaluru. I was teaching chess to some kids in the USA online already. Thanks to my friend for giving me the opportunity. I had online and offline chess classes along with the company salary. So I was earning more than I used to.

Gradually the number of students increased. Hourly payment was greater than what my company used to pay. This is the key factor to consider leaving the job.

I also had a curiosity about stock market. Since Indian stock market was/is booming, I thought to give it a try. I did not make any noticable revenue there but I'm holding on to few promising stocks.

I was going good with learning web designing but did not get a single project to work on except for a chess website for my friend.


## Helping Helps

I don't know if you know this but helping someone without expecting any return helps you in the long run. It doesn't have to be a monetary return. I'm an atheist but I value some of the words by Lord Krishna. You will know why I use a lot of Hindu mythology in my theme development.

I was learning Jekyll and I found that many people who are just starting off have a lot of issues which I also had in the beginning. I thought of documenting most of the things I have tackled while building my site, in a website and you are reading it.

I have also created a few videos to help people start off with Jekyll. Though the quality is just ok, I have received good feedbacks. Youtube partnership pays a little sum which is not significant right now but I beleive it is going to be good.

I have got many requests to develop websites through this blog. I'm glad I did this to help someone. And, it is helping me now. 

The donations have helped me buy few things that help me improvise the process.

## I always go for win-win than i-win

I have seen web designers and developers that develop websites for the sake of money. Yes, your work should be paid with money but that should be recovered by your client in the long run.

If you are provinding a product or service, reach out to your clients. Be happy to refund their money if it did not work for them or they are not happy with the results. But do not bend over back to impress your clients. That is too cheesy.

## Try different things

I have tried different ways of selling service and products online. I wasn't successful in all of them.
